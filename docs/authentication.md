# Websites that need authentication

If you want to take screenshots of a site that has some form of authentication, you will first need to authenticate with that website manually.

You can do that using the `shot-scraper auth` command:

    shot-scraper auth https://datasette-auth-passwords-demo.datasette.io/-/login auth.json

(For this demo, use username = `root` and password = `password!`)

This will open a browser window on your computer showing the page you specified.

You can then sign in using that browser window - including 2FA or CAPTCHAs or other more complex form of authentication.

When you are finished, hit `<enter>` at the `shot-scraper` command-line prompt. The browser will close and the authentication credentials (usually cookies) for that browser session will be written out to the `auth.json` file.

To take authenticated screenshots you can then use the `-a` or `--auth` options to point to the JSON file that you created:

    shot-scraper https://datasette-auth-passwords-demo.datasette.io/ \
      -a auth.json -o authed.png

## `shot-scraper auth --help`

from click.testing import CliRunner
runner = CliRunner()
result = runner.invoke(cli.cli, ["auth", "--help"])
help = result.output.replace("Usage: cli", "Usage: shot-scraper")
cog.out(
    "```\n{}\n```\n".format(help.strip())
)
]]] -->
```
