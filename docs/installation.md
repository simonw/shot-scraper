# Installation

Install this tool using `pip`:

    pip install shot-scraper

This tool depends on Playwright, which first needs to install its own dedicated Chromium browser.

Run `shot-scraper install` once to install that:
```
% shot-scraper install

If you want to use other browsers such as Firefox you should install those too:
```
% shot-scraper install -b firefox
```

## `shot-scraper shot --help`
